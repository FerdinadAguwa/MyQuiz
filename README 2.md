## Description
The website in front of you is a quiz about me. The quiz takes you through a series of questions and with each question that you get correct you are alerted of how successful you are. Every answer that you get wrong will let you know that your input was incorrect and deduct 10 seconds from the clock. See how many answers you can get correct. Good Luck!!!
